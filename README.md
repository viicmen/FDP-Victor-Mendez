# A Deep Learning approach to predict Transcription Factorâ€™s DNA Binding Motifs

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for predicting DNA-binding preferences of transcription factors in the form of position weight matrices (PWMs). It integrates sequence and structural similarity data to improve motif prediction accuracy. The model is trained on curated TF datasets and evaluated using alignment-based metrics. It includes data preprocessing scripts, model training, evaluation tools, and sequence logo generation.
